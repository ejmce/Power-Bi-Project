# Power-Bi-Project
This is a project I created to refresh myself on mySQL and to learn PowerBi, I followed a series posted by youtuber codebasics

This was also my first upload to github. So please click in to the first file to view the project.

I added the final result, the project bi file. And the csv files for each of the tables used.
